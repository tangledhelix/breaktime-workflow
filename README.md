A simple Alfred workflow to help automate when I start "working" mode
([Pomodoro][1]), and when I go back to "break-time" mode.

Uses a configurable list of apps to start or quit when switching modes.
Can hide (close) all windows of an app, and close a series of tabs in
Google Chrome.

Also turns Do Not Disturb mode on or off in Notification Center.

Use "work" or "break" keywords in Alfred to trigger.
