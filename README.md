A simple Alfred workflow to help automate when I start "working" mode
([Pomodoro][]), and when I go back to "break-time" mode.

Uses a configurable list of apps to start or quit when switching modes.
Can hide (close) all windows of an app, and close a series of tabs in
Google Chrome.

Also turns Do Not Disturb mode on or off in Notification Center.

Use "work" or "break" keywords in Alfred to trigger.

## Compatibility ##

It seems that if you are using [Bartender][], the Do Not Disturb toggle
does not work. So far I haven't found a way to fix that.
